## What is the DJI Payload SDK?

The DJI Payload SDK(PSDK), is a development kit provided by DJI to support developers to develop payload that can be
mounted on DJI drones. Combined with the X-Port, SkyPort or extension port adapter, developers can obtain the
information or other resource from the drone. According to the software logic and algorithm framework designed by the
developer, users could develop payload that can be mounted on DJI Drone, to perform actions they need, such as Automated
Flight Controller, Payload Controller, Video Image Analysis Platform, Mapping Camera, Megaphone And Searchlight, etc.

* FlyCart 30 aircraft supports the data subscription function.
* Fixed the issue with inaccurate zoom multiplier retrieval for the Mavic 3 Enterprise series cameras.
* Fixed data errors on the receiving end of small data transfers from MSDK to PSDK.
* Fixed the inability of devices at payload ports 2 and 3 of the M300 RTK aircraft to perform small data transmission to devices connected to the OSDK port.
* Fixed the issue where MSDK V5 and PSDK devices could not perform small data transmission when using M300 RTK and M350 RTK aircraft.
* Fixed occasional payload negotiation failures between PSDK and the M350 RTK aircraft.
* Fixed screen flickering and glitching issues with the H20T payload camera's video stream.
* Fixed issues with retrieving the visible light camera video stream from the M3TD camera.
* Optimized the C++ camera management sample.
